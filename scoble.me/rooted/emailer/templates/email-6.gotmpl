Welcome to Week 6 of Rooted: How Can I Make The Most Of My Life? Part 1

Freed from the snares of the enemy, we are now invited to 'continue to work out [our] salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in [us] to will and to act in order to fulfill His good purpose' (Philippians 2:12-13, NIV). Empowered by the Holy Spirit, we're called to manifest God's grace not just in words, but through purpose-driven actions that serve others.

### Week 6 Reading Highlights:

- **Day One**: Discover how God calls each one of us to serve in our own unique ways. Reflect on where you're being led to contribute positively.
  
- **Day Two**: Consider Jesus as the ultimate example for our desire to serve. What does it mean for you to serve with a similar heart?
  
- **Day Three**: Delve into the Great Commission as a universal Christian mission. How can you live out the principle of being "blessed to be a blessing"?
  
- **Day Four**: Identify where the Holy Spirit could empower you to serve others. Are there specific areas in your life you've identified?
  
- **Day Five**: Acknowledge your spiritual gifts. How can you use these gifts to make a meaningful difference in Las Vegas or in the world?
